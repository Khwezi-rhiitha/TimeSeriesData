# TimeSeriesData
Dataset represents a time series, to which statistical modeling and data analysis techniques are applied. 
I used R-studio and R programming to create the project.

# Report about the Electricity load dataset
I obtained this dataset from Saurabh Shahane account on Kaggle. It was last updated 4 years ago. This is a Short-term electricity load forecasting (Panama case study). It was previously sourced from: Aguilar Madrid, Ernesto (2021), “Short-term electricity load forecasting (Panama case study)”, Mendeley Data, V1, doi: 10.17632/byx7sztj59.1.


**About the dataset**
