#Considering the time series plot, the series appears to be stationary.
#The repeating seasonal pattern seems to have been stabilized, suggesting stationarity.
#Shows a sharp drop after lag 1, with most values within the significance bounds. 
#Displays a significant spike at lag 1, then quickly drops offâ€”another indicator of stationarity.

#c Using function auto.arima() determine optimal order of ARIMA

#The model is ARIMA(5,0,2)

#d Determine whether the series follows a white noise process
acf(load_forecast, main = "ACF of Load Forecast")

#The series does not follow the White Noise process.
#ACF Plot: Shows a significant spike at lag 1 and few more lags outside the confidence bounds. 
#--In a white noise process, all autocorrelations should be close to zero and within the bounds. 
#--This indicates autocorrelation is present, which violates white noise assumptions.
#PACF Plot: Also shows a strong spike at lag 1, suggesting partial autocorrelation. White noise should have no significant partial autocorrelations.

#e Considering lags 5, 10, 15, 20, 25 and 30.Test whether the residuals of the specified model are white noise.
#Ho: Series of residuals is white noise

  print(paste("i =", i, "p-value=", Box.test(load_forecast,i,type="Ljung")$p.value))
#All the p-values in the output are less than alpha=0.05, we reject the null hypothesis. 
#Therefore, according to this test the residual series can not be considered as white noise.
